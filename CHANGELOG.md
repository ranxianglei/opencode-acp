### v1.14.25 — Self-disable under the billion-context proxy

**Problem**: Users running `bili opencode` (the billion-context launcher) got BOTH stacks at once: the proxy injects compress / decompress / search_context / acp_status at the wire level and adds its own `/acp` panel, while opencode-acp registered the same tool names and a competing `/acp` — duplicate tools and a client-side panel shadowing the proxy's real compression state.

**Fix** (#335):
- The plugin now checks `process.env.BILLION_CONTEXT_PROXY` (always exported by the `bili` launcher) at startup and, when set, logs one line and returns an empty plugin object — no tools, no commands, no transforms.
- Zero behavior change without the env var; standalone installs are byte-for-byte identical.

**Install**: `opencode plugin opencode-acp@latest --global`
