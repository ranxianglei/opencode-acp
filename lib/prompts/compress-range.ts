export const COMPRESS_RANGE = `Collapse a range in the conversation into a detailed summary.

THE SUMMARY
Follow the HOW TO COMPRESS rules from the system prompt — keep every listed VERBATIM item, drop every listed noise category, and order by PRIORITY when space is tight. Do not restate the lists here; the system prompt is the single source of truth.

The summary must be self-contained — the original conversation adds no value after compression. Write dense, scannable bullets. Every line must earn its place.

COMPRESSED BLOCK PLACEHOLDERS
The system auto-detects any previously compressed blocks whose anchor messages fall inside your selected range. You do NOT need to manually list \`(bN)\` placeholders in your summary — every consumed block is tracked automatically.

Compressed block sections in context are clearly marked with a header:

- \`[Compressed conversation section]\`

Rules:

- Write a short prose summary. The system handles block consumption automatically.
- Do not invent placeholders for blocks outside the selected range.
- Treat \`(bN)\` as a RESERVED TOKEN. Do not emit \`(bN)\` text anywhere in the summary.
- If you need to mention a block in prose, use plain text like \`compressed bN\` (never as a placeholder).

BOUNDARY IDS
You specify boundaries by ID using the injected IDs visible in the conversation:

- \`mNNNNN\` IDs identify raw messages
- \`bN\` IDs identify previously compressed blocks

Each message has an ID inside XML metadata tags like \`<dcp-message-id>...</dcp-message-id>\`.
The same ID tag appears in every tool output of the message it belongs to — each unique ID identifies one complete message.
Treat these tags as boundary metadata only, not as tool result content.

Rules:

- Pick \`startId\` and \`endId\` directly from injected IDs in context.
- IDs must exist in the current visible context. If you cannot see an ID in the messages above, it is stale and will fail.
- \`startId\` must appear before \`endId\`.
- Do not invent IDs. Use only IDs that are present in context.
- NEVER use IDs from compressed block summaries, previous nudges, or your own memory — only IDs currently visible as XML metadata tags in the conversation.

BATCHING
When multiple independent ranges are ready and their boundaries do not overlap, include all of them as separate entries in the \`content\` array of a single tool call. Each entry should have its own \`startId\`, \`endId\`, and \`summary\`.
